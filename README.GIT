Users intending to modify this code further should note that many patterns are
listed in .gitignore to prevent tracking of either autogenerated code,
run-time files, or other post-compilation generated stuff. If new files are not
visible with "git status" check the .gitignore file in this directory. If modified
files are not visible with "git status," you can also check the .gitignore
file but there is a good chance that any changes to those files will be overwritten
during compilation.
