# Problem description

*Describe the problem in detail here:*
- *Indicate which branch of the repository you were working from.*
- *Say what you were trying to do when the error occured (e.g. configuring, compiling, preparing input, or running WRF.*
- *Indicate which configuration option you chose (e.g. `Linux i486 i586 i686, gfortran compiler with gcc dmpar`)*
- *In general, but __especially__ if you have made any changes to the code, try recompiling from scratch (`./clean -a` then recompile)
and verify that the problem persists. See the point below on providing log files as well before you do this.*
- *Provide any error messages that were given.*
- *Provide log files as a `.txt` file:*
  - *During a clean compile, redirect the output into a `.txt` file, e.g. `./compile em_real >& wrf_compile.log` and upload `wrf_compile.log`*
  - *If the problem occurs while running `real.exe`, `convert_emiss.exe`, or `wrf.exe`, provide the `rsl.error` file for the task that errored, if running in parallel
    (you may need to rename it with a `.txt` extension if GitHub will not accept it) or the results of redirecting output into a `.txt` file
    (e.g. `./wrf.exe >& wrf_run.txt`) if running in serial.*
- *If the problem occurs while running `real.exe`, `convert_emiss.exe`, or `wrf.exe`, also provide a copy of your namelist files.*


# Efforts tried to resolve the problem

*This section is optional*

*Describe any actions you took to resolve the problem. Include any relevant links to e.g. NCAR documents or WRF Users Forum pages that
you found that may be relevant.*
